# Telemetry
Telemetry is a data collector server for [Kubectyl Panel](https://github.com/kubectyl/panel) built with Cloudflare Worker and D1 database.
The primary reason for collecting this data is to help us make better decisions about the future of this software.

This repository hosts the source code for our Cloudflare Worker, designed with a focus on transparency and data collection from our users. We believe in open and accountable practices, which is why we have made this worker public. By making the worker code available, we aim to provide transparency about the data we collect, how we handle it, and the measures we take to protect user privacy.
